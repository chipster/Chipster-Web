  Keep the scroll position when changing visualizations

  During initialization, visualizations may show only one status text line if anything. This would make the page
  shorter and forces the browser to scroll it upwards. This min-height makes sure that the page is always long enough
  to keep its scroll position. Value of 100vh should be always enough, because if the user would have scrolled more than
  that, the tabs wouldn't be visible anymore and it wouldn't be possible to change the visualization.
